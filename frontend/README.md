# pixel-chunk frontend

Install depedencies:
```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

You must have the backend running to use the frontend. Locally it will be proxied to `http://localhost:8000`.

Build for production:

npm run build
```

In production, this project assumes the frontend is bundled and served from the backend.
